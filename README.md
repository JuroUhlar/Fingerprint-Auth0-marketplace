# Fingerprint For Auth0 Marketplace

The Fingerprint and Okta Customer Identity Cloud (CIC) powered by Auth0 integration is designed to provide a unique identifier for each of your user's devices. This is a powerful signal that helps reduce fraud and improve the user experience. 

The integration is powered by Fingerprint Pro's device detection technology, which is an industry-leading solution that quickly and accurately identifies the characteristics of a browser or device. The device information, with unparalleled accuracy, is then used to create a unique and immutable device fingerprint that can be used to securely identify a user's device and detect any malicious activity.

## Implementation

Fingerprint supports 2 integrations with Okta Customer Identity Cloud (CIC) powered by Auth0. One for Account Takeover at Login and the other for User Sign-up / Registration fraud. Please see each folder in this repostory for more details on each integration:
